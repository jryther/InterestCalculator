8-1 Journal: Portfolio Submission

This project was to provide an interface to a user to allow them to input data about investment amounts, monthly deposits, interest, and length of time and then produce charts summarizing the growth.  I think I did a great job with using formatted output to decrease the number of code and increase readability.  The project taught me how to write interfaces quickly using setfill and setw functions.  I don’t think there is much within my current toolset I could do to enhance the code since the project was pretty small in scope.  Creating the interface was pretty challenging because I was new to the syntax but it didn’t take long for me to figure it out.  I think that by teaching me efficient ways to make interfaces the lessons from this project will transfer over to many more that require user input.  Overall I think I did a good job with organization and leaving relevant comments in the code that made the program maintainable, readable and adaptable.
